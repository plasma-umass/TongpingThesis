\label{sec:applications}

We have implemented three error detection tools with \doubletake{}. These applications are intended to demonstrate \doubletake{}'s generality and efficiency. The mechanisms used here are similar to those used by existing tools, but \doubletake{} runs with substantially lower overhead than prior tools.

\subsection{Heap Buffer Overflow Detection}
\label{sec:applications/overflow}
% Describe the basic setup, what evidence of an error will look like, and what the tool can report
Heap buffer overflows occur when programs write outside the bounds of an allocated object. Our buffer overflow detector places canaries between heap objects, and reports an error when canary values have been overwritten. If an overwritten canary is found, the detector uses watchpoints during re-execution to identify the instruction responsible for the overflow.

\subsubsection*{Detection}
% Describe the implementation of detection

Figure~\ref{fig:buffer-overflow} presents an overview of the approach used to locate buffer overflows. All heap objects of \doubletake{} are managed by power of two size, adding two words for canaries (16 bytes) for each heap object. For an allocation size not power of two size (a non-aligned object), \doubletake{} rounds it up to the next power of two size class, putting byte-based canaries and word-based canaries immediately after this object. This approach lets \doubletake{} catch overflows as small as one byte. 
At memory deallocation, \doubletake{} checks buffer overflow for non-aligned objects, with size different with the power of two class. 
At the end of each epoch, \doubletake{} checks whether any canaries before and after aligned objects have been overwritten. For those non-aligned objects, \doubletake{} also checks buffer overflows before an object is freed. If an overwritten canary is found, a buffer overflow has been detected and re-execution begins.

\subsubsection*{Re-Execution}
% Describe the procedure for re-executing and reporting additional details

\doubletake{} installs a watchpoint at the address of the corrupted canary before re-execution. When the program is re-executed, any instruction that writes to this address will trigger the watchpoint. The operating system will deliver a \texttt{SIGTRAP} signal to \doubletake{} before the instruction is executed. By handling this signal, \doubletake{} reports the call stack of trapped instructions, obtained by using \texttt{backtrace} function.

\subsection{Use-After-Free Detection}
% Describe the basic setup, what evidence of an error will look like, and what the tool can report
\label{sec:applications/useafterfree}
 
Use-after-free or dangling pointer overflow errors occur when an application continues to access memory through pointers that have been passed to \texttt{free()} or \texttt{delete}. Writes to freed memory can overwrite the contents of other live objects, leading to unexpected program behavior. Like the buffer overflow detector, our use-after-free detector uses canaries to detect writes to freed memory. When a use-after-free error is detected, \doubletake{} reports the allocation and deallocation sites of the object, and all instruction(s) that wrote to the object after it was freed.

\subsubsection*{Detection}
% Describe the implementation of detection

Figure~\ref{fig:dangling-pointer} illustrates how to detect use-after-free. The use-after-free detector delays the re-allocation of freed memory. Freed objects are placed in a FIFO quarantine list, the same mechanism used by AddressSanitizer~\cite{AddressSanitizer}. Objects are released from the quarantine list when the total size of quarantined objects exceeds 16 megabytes, or when there are 1,024 quarantined objects. This threshold is easily configurable. Objects in the quarantine list are filled with canary values, up to 128 bytes. Filling large objects entirely with canaries introduces too much overhead during normal execution, and is unlikely to catch any additional errors. 

Before an object can be returned to the program heap, \doubletake{} verifies that no canaries has been overwritten. All canaries are checked at epoch boundaries. If a canary has been overwritten, the detector raises an error and begins re-execution.

\subsubsection*{Re-Execution}
% Describe the procedure for re-executing and reporting additional details

During re-execution, the use-after-free detector interposes on \texttt{malloc} and \texttt{free} calls to find the allocation and deallocation sites of the overwritten object. The detector records a call stack for both sites using the \texttt{backtrace} function. After the object is freed, the detector installs a watchpoint at the address of the overwritten canary. As with buffer overflow detection, any writes to the watched address will generate a \texttt{SIGTRAP} signal. The last allocation and deallocation sites, and the instructions responsible for the use-after-free error are reported at the end of re-execution.

\subsection{Memory Leak Detection}
\label{sec:applications/leak}
% Describe the basic setup, what evidence of an error will look like, and what the tool can report
Heap memory is leaked when it becomes inaccessible without being freed. Memory leaks can significantly degrade program performance due to increased memory footprint. Our leak detector identifies possible unreachable allocated objects at the end of each epoch. Allocation sites can help users fix memory leaks, but collecting these information for all\texttt{malloc} calls would unnecessarily slow down the program in normal execution for the common case (no memory leaks). Instead, \doubletake{} only records the allocation sites of leaked memory during re-execution, and adds no overhead for normal execution.

\subsubsection*{Detection}
% Describe the implementation of detection

We detect memory leaks using the same marking mechanism as conservative garbage collection~\cite{Wilson:1992:UGC:645648.664824}. The marking phase performs a breadth-first scan of reachable memory using a work queue. Initially, all values in registers, globals, and the stack that look like pointers are added to the work queue. Any eight-byte aligned value that falls within the range of allocated heap memory is treated as a pointer.

At each step in the scan, the detector takes the first item off the work queue. Using the heap metadata located before each object, the detector finds the bounds of a object. Every object is allocated with a header containing ``marked'' and ``allocated'' bits. If the ``marked'' bit is set, the detector removes this object and moves on to the next item in the queue. If the object is allocated and unmarked, the detector sets the ``marked'' bit and adds all pointer values within the object's bounds to the work queue. When the work queue is empty, \doubletake{} ends its scan.

\doubletake{} then traverse the whole heap to find those allocated but unmarked objects. They are identified as memory leaks. If there are memory leaks, re-execution begins. The detector can also find potential dangling pointers (reachable freed objects). This option is disabled by default because, unlike other applications, potential dangling pointer detection could produce false positives.

\subsubsection*{Re-Execution}
% Describe the procedure for re-executing and reporting additional details

During re-execution, the leak detector checks the results of each \texttt{malloc} call. When the allocation of a leaked object is found, the detector records the call stack using the \texttt{backtrace} function. At the end of the epoch re-execution, the detector reports the last call stack for each leaked object.
