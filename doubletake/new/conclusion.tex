This paper introduces \emph{evidence-based dynamic analysis}, a new
lightweight dynamic analysis technique. Evidence-based dynamic
analysis works for errors that can be forced to leave evidence of
their presence. These errors include key problems for C and C++
programs: buffer overflows, dangling-pointer errors, and memory
leaks. Evidence-based dynamic analysis is fast because it lets the
application run at full speed until an error is detected; execution is
then rolled back and replayed with instrumentation at the point where
the evidence was found, pinpointing the error. We
present \doubletake{}, the first evidence-based dynamic analysis
framework, and implement these analyses inside it. The resulting
analyses are the fastest versions to date, demonstrating the
effectiveness and efficiency of this new dynamic analysis approach.
