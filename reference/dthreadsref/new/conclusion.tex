\dthreads{} is a deterministic replacement for the \pthreads{}
library that supports general-purpose multithreaded
applications. It is straightforward to deploy:
\dthreads{} resuires no source code, and operates on commodity hardware. By converting threads
into processes, \dthreads{} leverages process isolation and virtual
memory protection to track and isolate concurrent memory updates with
low overhead. Changes are committed deterministically at natural
synchronization points in the code, rather than at boundaries based on
hardware performance counters. \dthreads{} not only ensures full
internal determinism---eliminating data races as well as
deadlocks---but does so in a way that is portable and easy to
understand. Its software architecture prevents false sharing, a
notorious performance problem for multithreaded applications running
on multiple, cache-coherent processors. The combination of these
approaches enables \dthreads{} to match or even exceed the performance
of \pthreads{} for the majority of the benchmarks examined here,
making \dthreads{} a safe and efficient alternative to \pthreads{} for
many applications.
