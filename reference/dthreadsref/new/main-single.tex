Notes from Daan Leijen:

Generally, I think the paper could have been clearer to me if it would have 
separated out more the actual implementation from the intended semantics.
Currently I found myself trying to decode the implementation to figure out
the semantics. Also, in the introduction you remark “Dthreads guarantees
deterministic execution of multithreaded programs even in the presence of
data races (notwithstanding external sources of non-determinism like I/O):
given the same sequence of inputs, a program using dthreads always produces
the same output”. This is somewhat ambiguous to me. Perhaps it is good to
remark that a Dthread program is deterministic with respect to any
particular scheduling of the threads? Clearly, any other source of
non-determinism will cause a dthread program to be non-deterministic (like I/O).

\begin{abstract}
Multithreaded programming is notoriously difficult to get right.  A key problem
is non-determinism, which complicates debugging, testing, and reproducing
errors. One way to simplify multithreaded programming is to enforce
deterministic execution, but current deterministic systems for C/C++ are
incomplete or impractical. These systems require program modification, do not
ensure determinism in the presence of data races, do not work with
general-purpose multithreaded programs, or run up to $8.4\times$ slower than
\pthreads{}.

This paper presents \dthreads{}, an efficient deterministic multithreading
system for unmodified C/C++ applications that replaces the \pthreads{} library.
\Dthreads{} enforces determinism in the face of data races and deadlocks. 
\dthreads{} works by exploding multithreaded applications into multiple
processes, with private, copy-on-write mappings to shared memory.  It uses
standard virtual memory protection to track writes, and deterministically orders
updates by each thread. By separating updates from different threads,
\dthreads{} has the additional benefit of eliminating false sharing.
Experimental results show that \dthreads{} substantially outperforms a
state-of-the-art deterministic runtime system, and for a majority of the
benchmarks evaluated here, matches and occasionally exceeds the performance of
\pthreads{}.
\end{abstract}
