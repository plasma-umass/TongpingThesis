We plan to extend \sheriff{} to find more performance related problems in
multithreaded programs. For example, if one frequently-read word
happens to be in the same cache line with one frequently-written word,
it would be better to separate those two words. But in the current
framework, \sheriff{} cannot detect a single memory read operation using the
twin page mechanism. We are examining the combination of hardware
watchpoints to help us locate this kind of performance error. In
addition, we plan to exploit watchpoints to capture those program
counters that touch specific addresses so as to point the programmer
to specific lines of code responsible for false sharing.
