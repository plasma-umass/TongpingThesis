Story:
Multi-core processors or NUMA are now widely used in order to avoid the physical limits of hardware. 
Multi-threaded is considered as one way to take full advantage of those computation resources. Unfornately, 
writing efficient multi-threaded program is not an easy task; 
false sharing problem can reduce the performance greatly, 
even worse, one program with serious false sharing problem can run slower on multi-core machine that that on 
on single-core machine with the same cpu frequency of every core.

This paper presents Sheriff, a system to detect those false sharing problem in multi-threaded c/c++ programs. 
Comparing to previous tool, Sheriff has a very low performance overhead, 
averagely the performance overhead is about 15\% in our experiments. 
For most programs, Sheriff can run almost the same speed or even faster than original program
using pthreads library. 
The second advantage of Sheriff is that there is no false positives at all. 
The false sharing problems reported by Sheriff are actual false sharing problems.

The third adanvatage of Sheriff is that Sheriff can pinpoint the code to cause the false sharing problems. 
For heap objects, Sheriff can point out the allocation site, 
then it is easy for programmer to fix the false sharing problem given the callsite information,
even for some one that are not familiar with the code. 
For global objects, Sheriff can point out those objects' name and length information which has false sharing problem.

How Sheriff to do that?
First, we are using a runtime system which maintains the semantics of multi-threaded program.
To detect those modifications by different threads, we turn those multi-threaded program into a 
multi-process program and use the page protection mechanism to capture those writes on different threads.
In order to capture those writes of different memory, we introduce a "twin" page in the page fault handler;
then we utilize the lazy differentiating mechanism (which has been widely used in distributed share memory) to 
find acutal writes in each phase. 
In order to capture those cache invalidation of different threads, we maintain a global array which is used to
maintain the last thread id to write on one cache line. We use a 
conservative mechanism to count those invalidation of cache lines, 
only those interleaving writes by different threads are counted as an invalidation of corresponding cache line. 
In order to differentiate the false sharing problem from true sharing problem, 
we also keep a word-based version number array 
which is used to record every writes information on each word, including thread id and version. (We use a special
id to identify multi-threads on one word).
 
Also, this word-based versioning mechanism
can help us to the precisely locate the object that are causing the problem if multiple objects are located in 
the same physical cache line.

In order to catch those false sharing problem caused by long transaction, 
we introduce one "sampling mechanism" which can get continutive writes of different threads.

In order to pingpoint the allocation site, we will attach the callsite information for those allocation. Then we can present those callsite when we find out much invalidation. 
 
What else Sheriff can do?
First, Sheriff can work as a run-time system, which can tolerate some of the false sharing problems. 
Second, Sheriff can work as a system which can detect those race condition problems undetectable using those lock-set based tool.
Third, Sheriff can also work as a system to tolerate race problem, like Isolator.

Future work:
(1) Pinpoint the line number to access the cache line by using the "watch point" technique.
(2) Figure out the problem caused by read-write false sharing problem by using the "watch point" technique.
(3) Design a run-time system which can tolerate the false sharing problem in a very low overhead. Profiling 
on specified input should be very helpful to find the problem.
