The general trend in processor development has moved to the multi-core era: 
dual-cores, quad-cores, or even hundreds of cores are common in the same machine. 
Multi-threading is a general approach in order to fully utilize these CPU resources.
However, writing multithreaded programs is still challenging: multithreaded 
applications are susceptible to performance anomalies and concurrency errors 
that are notoriously difficult to debug.

First, it is very difficult to make multithreaded programs efficient.
The false sharing is insidious for multithreaded programs
running on multicore processors, where it can silently degrade
performance and scalability. Worse, some common programming practice
can easily cause false sharing problems.

Second, it is hard to write correct multithreaded programs.  
Because thread interleavings can happen randomly and differently,  
programs may run differently in different executions. 
This non-deterministic behavior makes it hard to understand and debug multi-threaded programs.

Third, it is hard to detect races effectively and efficiently, 
one of the concurrency problems of multithreaded 
programs, because of exploding possibilities of thread interleavings\cite{interleavingcoverage}. 
Approaches based on \texttt{happens-before} can not detect all races while introducing
significant performance overhead. lockset based approaches can detect all races with 
too many false positives.   
%easily causing significant performance overhead. 
%it is impossible to explore all possible interleavings 
%find all programs' errors by 
%in the development phase. Thus it is beneficial to have a low-overhead debugging system, 
%helping to identify and report the possible program errors in the actual deployed environment. 

In this proposal, we address all of these difficulties and make the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \Sheriff{}:
%\item \textbf{\Sheriff{}}:
We provide two tools to deal with false sharing problems
of multithreaded programs based on the same \Sheriff{} framework~\cite{sheriff}, 
by extending the \emph{processes-as-threads} concept introduced
in our Grace paper~\cite{grace}.
%By replacing threads with processes with the shared file descriptor table, 
%this framework allows programs to perform per-thread memory isolation and write
%tracking on a per-page basis by utilizing standard memory protection mechanism.
%By utilizing the twining-and-diffing mechanism, \sheriff{} can find memory modifications
%inside different threads and commit those local updates to the shared mapping at synchronization
%boundaries.
\SheriffDetect{} can find instances of false sharings by comparing updates of
the same cache lines by different threads, and ranking problems by performance impact. 
\SheriffDetect{} is accurate (no false positives), runs with low overhead (on average 20\%), and can precisely pinpoint the exact objects involved in false sharing.
\SheriffProtect{} mitigates false sharing problems by adaptively isolating shared 
updates from different threads into separate physical addresses, effectively 
eliminating the performance impact of false sharing. 
%\textbf{Real Impact}:\sheriffDetect{} is a open-source project on GitHub and is 
%utilized by the \textbf{SAS} and \textbf{Intel} company to locate false sharing 
%problems inside their products. 

%\SheriffProtect{} 
%can be used in the following cases: it is infeasible to fix false sharing problems 
%when source is unavailable, or undesirable when padding objects would unacceptably 
%increase memory consumption or further worsen runtime performance. 

\item \Dthreads{}:
We developed an efficient deterministic multithreading system, \dthreads{}~\cite{dthreads}, 
for unmodified C/C++ applications by replacing the existing \pthreads{} library.
\dthreads{} outperforms a state-of-the-art runtime system (CoreDet)
by a factor of 3, and often matches and sometimes exceeds the performance with \pthreads{}.
\Dthreads{} enforces robust/stable determinism even in the face of data races, 
greatly simplifying program understanding and debugging: 
programs always behave the same, even with different inputs and on different hareware,
as long as the synchronization order is staying the same. 
Because of this, \dthreads{} can also be used to support \textbf{replicated executions} 
of multithreaded applications for fault tolerance purposes.

%\sheriff{} framework provides a per-thread-isolation functionality, which is perfectly suitable
%for the determinism purpose since a thread's modifications won't be seen by other threads.


%\dthreads{} works by exploding multithreaded applications into multiple processes, with 
%private, copy-on-write mappings to the same shared memory, isolating the memory writes from different threads. 
%It then uses standard virtual memory protection to track writes, and deterministically orders updates by each thread. 
%By isolating updates from different threads, \dthreads{} has the additional benefit of eliminating false sharing.

%\sheriff{} framework provides a per-thread-isolation functionality, which is perfectly suitable 
%for the determinism purpose since a thread's modifications won't be seen by other threads.
%Building on \sheriff{} framework, \dthreads{} isolates memory accesses, commits threads' updates 
%in a deterministic order and synchronizes threads deterministically.

\item \DoubleTake{}:
We propose \DoubleTake{} to detect \textbf{write-write} races effectively, precisely, and efficiently.
\DoubleTake{} verifies all write accesses inside the same epoch, while 
concurrent accesses from different threads inside the same epoch are considered
to be races. In order to locate races precisely, \DoubleTake{} re-executes programs after installing 
watch points on problematic memory addresses. 
Since \DoubleTake{} only checks memory errors at boundaries of synchronizations and system calls,
instead of before every memory access like traditional approaches, 
the overhead of \DoubleTake{} can be amortized over a long execution time. 
To replay the executions of  multithreaded programs, we
are planning to built \DoubleTake{} on top of the \dthreads{} framework.
% Most of existing tools to detect races are based on a pess 
% to achieve the determinism target.
  
%Whenever some memory errors detected, like races or buffer overflows, 
%we can re-execute the program and utilize the hardware watchpoints to 
%locate the origin of problems precisely. 
%We have finished a practical buffer overflow detection tool for single-threaded program, which only
%introduces negligible performance overhead (about 2\%), much lower than the state-of-the-art technique. 
%The state-of-the-art tool to detect the buffer overflow problem,  
%AddressSanitizer from \texttt{Google}, introduces about 26\% performance overhead.

%However, checking memory errors using this technique for multithreaded programs
% is much more complicated 
%than that for single-threaded programs. 
%Because numerous possible thread interleavings can happen in the re-execution phase, we should  
%ensure deterministic rollbacks of the programs in order to precisely locate
%the memory errors.
%We are proposing to rely on the \dthreads{} framework to achieve this determinism target.
%By combining with \dthreads{} and watchpoint technique, we can find out those memory errors in some specific
%scheduling order, which also verify one claim of determinism: 
%deterministic system is useful to locate the memory errors.

\end{itemize}

difficulties to write multithreaded programs.
