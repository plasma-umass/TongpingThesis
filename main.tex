%% This is a sample doctoral dissertation.  It shows the appropriate
%% structure for your dissertation.  It should handle most of the
%% strange requirements imposed by the Grad school; like the different
%% handling of titles of one/many appendices.  It will automatically
%% handle the linespacing changes.  The body default is double-spaced
%% (except when you use the singlespace or condensed options).  The
%% default for quotations is single-space, and the default for tabular
%% environments is also single-space.  
%%
%% This class adds the following commands and environments to the
%% report class, upon which it is based:
%% Commands
%% ------------
%% \degree{name}{abbrv} -- Sets the name and abbreviation for the degree.
%%                         These default to ``Doctor of Philosopy''
%%                         and ``Ph.D.'', respectively.
%% \copyrightyear{year} -- for the copyright page.
%% \bachelors{degree}{institution} -- for the abstract
%% \masters{degree}{institution}   --  "
%%     if you have other degrees you may use
%% \secondbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \secondmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \priordoctorate{degree}{institution}
%%
%% \committeechair{name}           -- for the signature page
%% or, if you have two co-chairs:
%% \cochairs{first name}{second name}
%%
%% \firstreader{name}              --  "
%% \secondreader{name}             --  "

%% \sixthreader{name}              --  "
%% \departmentchair{name}          -- for the signature page
%% \departmentname{name}           --  "
%%
%% \copyrightpage                  -- produces the copyright page
%% \signaturepage                  -- produces the signature page
%%
%% \frontmatter                    -- these are required in their various
%% \mainmatter                     -- appropriate locations
%% \backmatter                     --
%%
%% \unnumberedchapter[toc]{name}   -- like \chapter, except that it
%%                                    produces an unnumbered chapter;
%%                                    alternatively, like \chapter*,
%%                                    except that it lists the chapter
%%                                    in the table of contents.
%%
%% New environments:
%%   dedication  -- for the dedication
%%   abstract    -- for the abstract
%%
%% The thesis documentclass is built on top of the report document class.
%% It accepts all of the options that the report class accepts, plus the
%% following:
%%     doublespace -- the default, indicates double spacing as per U.Mass.
%%                    requirements.  You will need this when you do your
%%                    final copy.
%%     singlespace -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school
%%     condensed   -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school,
%%                    creates condensed versions of the frontmatter. 
%%                    Condensed implies singlespace.
%%     dissertation - the default, indicates that this document is a
%%                    dissertation.
%%     proposal    -- indicates that this document is a dissertation proposal,
%%                    rather than a dissertation.  This will only change the
%%                    wording on the title and signature pages.
%%     thesis      -- indicates that this document is a Master's thesis 
%%                    rather than a doctoral dissertation.  This also changes
%%                    the default for \degree to Master of Science, M.S.
%%     allowlisthypenation -- (the default), allows hyphenation of words in
%%                    the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list
%%                    of tables.  I believe that this is acceptable to the 
%%                    Graduate School.
%%     nolisthyphenation -- disallows hyphenation of words in the table of
%%                    contents and the list of figures and tables.  Use this 
%%                    option if the Grad School doesn't like your hyphenation.
%%     nicerdraft  -- relaxes some of the Grad School's rules for working with
%%                    drafts -- has no effect when doublespace is in effect
%%     nonicerdraft -- the default, leaves things in draft as they will be in
%%                     the final version
%% umthesis changes the default font size to 12pt, but you may specify 10pt or
%%   11pt in the options.

\begin{abstract}                % Abstract
The advent of multicore architecture has increased the demand for multithreaded
programs, but writing them remains painful for programmers. 
It is notoriously far more challenging to write concurrent programs correctly and 
efficiently than sequential ones because of the wide range of performance problems and 
concurrency errors, including false sharing, race conditions, deadlocks, etc. 

In this proposal we introduce a series of runtime systems to combat performance problems and 
concurrency errors of multithreaded problems.
The first system, \Sheriff{}, attacks the notorious performance problem of 
multithreaded programs, false sharing. \Sheriff{} can precisely detect false 
sharing problems without false positives and automatically mitigate false sharing 
problems without user intervention. 
The second system, \dthreads{}, automatically ensures determinism for unmodified C/C++
applications without requiring programmer intervention. \dthreads{} leverages virtual 
memory and process isolation, combined with a deterministic commit protocol, 
to ensure robust deterministic execution with very low runtime overhead.
Finally, we propose \DoubleTake{}, a novel detection tool for write-write races based on synchronization
 boundaries.
\DoubleTake{} detects more races than the standard happens-before
approaches without introducing false positives, unlike lockset based approaches.
\DoubleTake{} can also locate those heap-based overflows and 
underflows without adding perceptible performance overhead.
