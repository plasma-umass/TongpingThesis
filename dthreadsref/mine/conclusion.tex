\dthreads{} is a deterministic library for general multithreaded program, which supports
the full range of synchronizations of multithreaded library.
 
By treating threads as process, each process can work on its private copy, 
\dthreads{} can provide a strong isolation for concurrent memory accessing among different threads, 
thus prevent the expensive read/write tracking mechanism for current deterministic system. 

Since those modifications by different threads happened only on its private copy and won't be 
commited to share mapping until those synchronization points, 
\dthreads{} can prevent the false sharing problem, a notorious performance
problem for multithreaded programs.
Thus for most of benchmarks, \dthreads{} can achieve same or better performance than \texttt{pthreads} library.

Since \dthreads{} are scheduled based on more natural synchronization, instead of 
retired instructions which highly depending on hardware or compilation, 
\dthreads{} improves stability of scheduling without memoization. 

Considering the reasonable overhead, \dthreads{} can be worked as a deployable deterministic system 
for most of applications.
