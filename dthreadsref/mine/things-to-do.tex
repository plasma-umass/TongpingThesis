XXX Things to do punchlist:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pseudo-code for atomicBegin, atomicEnd, waitToken, and putToken.
\item Simple working example.
\item Picture for timeline of memory commit / fence.
\item Picture for phases (parallel then serial).
\end{enumerate}

Alternating phases and token mechanism based on CoreDet.
Process mechanism is based on Grace (though extended to support gen purpose synch).
Commit protocol is loosely based on Treadmarks (release consistency, diffs).

Note where overheads are, and how they are amortized.

New structure.
\begin{itemize}
\item memory first
\begin{itemize}
\item   simple example.
\item   thread begin, thread end (process stuff)
\item   atomic begin
\item   twinning \& diffing
\item   token protocol (global order by thread id);
\item serial mode begin and end. atomic end.
\end{itemize}
\item then synchronization
\begin{itemize}
\item   locks
\item   condition variables
\item   barriers
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
