This paper presents Sheriff, one software-only system to precisely detect false sharing problems
in multithreaded programs. 
Sheriff's key contribution is its runtime system framework, which simulating the running 
of threads using process. 
Sheriff uses the process's complete separation mechanism and page fault mechanism to capture writes
in one transaction by combining with twin page mechanism. 
In order to capture continuous writes in the same transaction, 
Sheriff introduce the sampling mechanism for those long-running
transactions. 
Unlike previous tools, Sheriff intercepts those memory allocation and de-allocation function calls so that
those false positives caused by re-use of dynamic objects can be avoided completely in Sheriff and also
Sheriff can attach callsite on those memory allocations, which can help to report those callsite 
information about one false sharing objects and save manual effort to locate the false sharing problems.

Sheriff can use preload attributes of library, which can work on unaltered binary files and makes the deployment
simple. Since Sheriff don't use the advanced hardware support, which can be used to find false sharing problems
for those legacy applications running on original hardware. 
For most of applications, sheriff only incurs reasonable runtime overhead, making it a 
practical choice even for those complex system which should run long time.
