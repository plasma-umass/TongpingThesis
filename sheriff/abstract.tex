False sharing is a notorious challenge for multi-threaded programs
running on multicore processors, where it can silently degrade
performance and scalability. Debugging false sharing problems is
extremely difficult. Previous approaches aimed at identifying false
sharing impose significant performance penalties (approximately 200X),
generate numerous false positives, and are unable to pinpoint the
sources of false sharing, at best pointing to particular addresses
accessed by functions.

This paper presents Sheriff, a software-only system that both
withstands and identifies false sharing in C/C++ applications. Sheriff
replaces the standard pthreads library and eliminates false sharing
problems, imposing low overhead for most programs (on average,
26\%) while dramatically speeding up performance in the presence of
catastrophic false sharing (by almost 10X). Sheriff also precisely
identifies the sources of false sharing without false positives. A
case study using Sheriff shows that it can be used to quickly identify
and correct false sharing issues in benchmarks from the Phoenix and
PARSEC benchmark suites.
