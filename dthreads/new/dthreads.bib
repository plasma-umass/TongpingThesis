%In this paper we provide definitions for several types of degenerate sharing,
%including false sharing. We also provide an algorithm that computes the cost of unnecessary
%coherence (false coherence) in a shared memory system using a single memory trace. Finally, we
%provide a counter intuitive example demonstrating that the elimination of degenerate sharing can
%reduce performance.
