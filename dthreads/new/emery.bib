  abstract = {In this paper, we present a flexible and efficient infrastructure for building memory allocators that is based on C++ templates and inheritance. This novel approach allows programmers to build custom and general-purpose allocators as "heap layers" that can be composed without incurring any runtime overhead or additional programming cost. We show that this infrastructure simplifies allocator construction and results in allocators that either match or improve the performance of heavily-tuned allocators written in C, including the Kingsley allocator and the GNU obstack library. We further show this infrastructure can be used to rapidly build a general-purpose allocator that has performance comparable to Lea's allocator, the best uniprocesor allocator of which we are aware. We thus demonstrate a clean, easy-to-use allocator interface that seamlessly combines the power and efficiency of any number of general and custom allocators within a single application.},

 booktitle = {2006 USENIX Annual Technical Conference},

 location = {Boston, Massachusetts},
 pages = {129--142},
 abstract = {Programming high-performance server applications is challenging: it is both complicated and error-prone to write the concurrent code required to deliver high performance and scalability. Server performance bottlenecks are difficult to identify and correct. Finally, it is difficult to predict server performance prior to deployment.

This paper presents Flux, a language that dramatically simplifies the construction of scalable high-performance server applications. Flux lets programmers compose off-the-shelf, sequential C or C++ functions into concurrent servers. Flux programs are type-checked and guaranteed to be deadlock-free. We have built a number of servers in Flux, including a web server with PHP support, an image-rendering server, a BitTorrent peer, and a game server. These Flux servers match or exceed the performance of their counterparts written entirely in C. By tracking hot paths through a running server, Flux simplifies the identification of performance bottlenecks. The Flux compiler also automatically generates discrete event simulators that accurately predict actual server performance under load and with different hardware resources.}

  booktitle = {2006 USENIX Annual Technical Conference},
  month = jun,
  year = {2006},
  location = {Boston, Massachusetts},
  pages = {109--114},
  abstract = {A multitude of research and commercial projects have proposed contributory systems that utilize wasted CPU cycles, idle memory and free disk space found on end-user machines. These applications include distributed computation such as signal processing and protein folding, peer-to-peer backup, and large-scale distributed storage. While users are generally willing to give up unused CPU cycles, the use of memory by contributory applications deters participation in such systems. Contributory applications pollute the machine's memory, forcing user pages to be evicted to disk. This paging can disrupt user activity for seconds or even minutes.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of an operating system mechanism to support transparent contribution of memory. A transparent memory manager (TMM) controls memory usage by contributory applications, ensuring that users will not notice an increase in the miss rate of their applications. TMM is able to protect user pages such that page miss overhead is limited to 1.7\%, while donating hundreds of megabytes of memory.}
