We are investigating ways to enhance the performance and determinism
guarantees of \dthreads{}.

While \dthreads{} ensures full \emph{internal} determinism, it does
not currently guarantee determinism if the application is sensitive
to \emph{external non-determinism}, such as the latency of network
connections or time of day. We are examining the use of a shim layer
to enforce deterministic delivery of such events in order to achieve
the same kind of external determinism guarantees provided by
dOS~\cite{deterministic-process-groups}, although without changes to
the underlying operating systems. We also plan to examine
whether \dthreads{} can be used directly in conjunction with dOS.

The key performance problem for \dthreads{} is when an application
modifies an extremely large number of pages. For those
benchmarks, \dthreads{} can incur high overheads. We plan to
incorporate an ownership protocol to limit page copying and thus
improve performance. In many cases, these pages are ``owned'' (read
and modified) by a single thread. Tracking these pages would
allow \dthreads{} to avoid copying modified private pages to the
shared memory space.
