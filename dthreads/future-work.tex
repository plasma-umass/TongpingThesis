Currently, we haven't handle those external non-determinism, for example, network input or timing,
which can affect the determinism if the applications are relying on that. 
One part of our future work wants to support these external non-determinism by using a shim layer to record those
external non-deterministic events. 
%Also, in current version, those memory allocation can be non-deterministic, which can potentially introduce some non-determinism if one application includes some un-safe memory operations. So we can easily to avoid this problem
%by recording those order to allocate one superblock.

Another part of our future-work are trying to handle the performance problem brought by too many dirty pages.
We can keep track of the ownership of one memory page. If one memory page is owned by one thread, normally
we don't need to commit those changes to the shared mapping. So page commits can be limitted to 
those actually shared page, hopefully we can improve the performance by using this mechanism.

%Replace effective single lock with guaranteed ordering on locks.
%Adopt ownership protocol a la DMP-O?
%Improve the determinism brought by the memory allocation, then we can fix those problem caused by un-safe memory operations.
%Support for external non-determinism.
